To add to our repo:

1. Create a new branch (name this the general feature/bug you are adding/working on)
   ` git branch <new branch name> `

2. Switch to new branch
    ` git checkout <branch name> `

3. Stage and commit changes
    ` git add <files changed> `
    ` git commit -m <files changed> `

4. Push the branch to the repo
   ` git push orgin <branch main> `

Then, just await team review and we'll merge to main!
